=== Personal Website using Retype and Github Actions

After creating this website, I noticed how many of my friends and colleagues were interested in making one of their own, but they felt they did not have the knowledge or time to do it. So I noticed that if I took advantage of GithubÂ´s Template function, I would allow anyone with a Github account the ability to create their website in a few clicks.

The following repository has all the code and instructions needed to create your website:

Technologies used: Retype, Github Actions.

==- Wordle App

This code is the first step before creating a flutter app that helps you play wordle. Currently, I have written the python code that will run the logic. What is missing is an interface for the user to input which letters are grey/yellow/green.
